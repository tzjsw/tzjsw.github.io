Hi! My name is Zhaolong Han and I am a fifth-year math PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu) at [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu) advised by [Prof. Xiaochuan Tian](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~xatian). Before that, I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at [Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020, where I enrolled in the [Special Class for the Gifted Young / Honors Youth Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young) in 2014.

My research interests lie in nonlocal models and their numerical methods. For more information, check out my [publications page](/publications/) and [CV page](/cv/).
